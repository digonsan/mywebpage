          <p class="contenido">
		    My name is Diana and I am currently an Associate TechOps Specialist at a company called <a href="https://www.sojern.com/" target="_blank">Sojern</a>. Besides that, I enjoy using my free time to do some programming, hang out with my loved ones, learn all sorts of new things, and travel. I decided to make this webpage just to put together some of the things that I have worked on in the past few years, as well as to share the side projects that I am currently working on. </p>
		  <p class="contenido">
		    I was born and raised in Mexico City, where I had the fortune of attending a multicultural school called<a href = "http://www.lancaster.edu.mx/" target="_blank"> La Escuela de Lancaster</a>. This is where I completed the <a href = "http://www.ibo.org/" target="_blank"> International Baccalaureate diploma </a> as well as the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) <a href= "http://www.dgire.unam.mx/contenido_wp/" target="_blank">CCH program</a> (Humanities and Science School). In 2013, I moved to California for university and, in June of 2017, I graduated from the <a href= "https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank"> University of California, Santa Cruz </a> (UCSC) with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics.

		  <p Class = "proyecto"> Purposeful </p>
		  <p Class = "contenido"> I am collaborating with my friends <a href = "oparra.me">Oscar Parra</a> and James Kennedy to start-up a new web-based project called <a href="https://bepurposeful.io" target="_blank">Purposeful</a>. This project seeks to facilitate mentorships across people who want to gain skills in a certain area, and people who already have those skills. The project will also provide a plataform for teams to be formed in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the Purposeful platform is currently under construction and I will be sure to post a link to it here when it comes to life. </p>
		  <p Class = "proyecto"> McGehee Tree  </p>
		  <p Class = "contenido"> I am working with<a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~cfjackma/" target="_blank"> Connor Jackman</a> to make a Python program that can plot a tree that results from the recursive iteration of the function $$f(z) = z - \overline{z}^2$$ Where \(z = x + iy\) is a complex number (and \(\overline{z} = x - iy\) is its conjugate). </p>
		  <p Class = "contenido"> That is, for every \(z_0 \in [0,1]\) we recursively find all the branches of the equation $$z_i = z_{i+1} - \overline{z}_{i+1}^2 = f(z_{i+1})$$ For \(1 \leq i \leq n\), where \(n\) is a chosen number of finite iterations to approximate what happens in infinity. Notice that the number of seeds would also need to be infinite, but for the purpose of plotting the tree we use a finite number of seeds by dividing the interval \([0, 1]\) in equal chunks and using the dividing points as seeds. </p>
		  <p class = "contenido"> We used the Newton method to approximate roots of non-linear equations and exploited the symmetries of the expected graph to generate a faster plotting. Below is shown the plot for two iterations. However, we still need to fix some details for when there is a large number of iterations.

		  <p Class = "contenido"> I worked on this project with <a href = "https://www.behance.net/intton" target="_blank"> Intton Godelg </a> in the Summer of 2015. We were hired by Alejandra Medellin and Dolores Ponce to create a visualization of their research on the dancer and choreographer Pilar Medina. Intton did most of the design and some of the programming, while I did some of the design and most of the programming. It was a fun experience.

		  <p Class = "contenido"> I made this poster for my Technical Writing final project at UCSC on Winter quarter 2017. It went along with a research report I wrote about Convolutional Neural Networks and how they are used for Image Captioning. I enjoyed to learn about these topics a lot and hopefully I get to learn much more about them in the future.

		    </a>
		  </p>
		  <p Class = "contenido"> I put this portfolio together in Fall 2016 as a final project for my Mathematical Problem Solving class at UCSC. The class was an upper division elective that I took to complete my mathematics minor. It was really fun and it made me feel motivated to participate in the <a href = "https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition" target="_blank"> Putnam exam </a> that year, which was very challenging but also very fun. 
		  </p>
		  <p Class = "proyecto"> Random Bipartite Graph (Java) </p>
		  <p Class = "contenido"> Once while at UCSC, a professor recommended me to read a bunch of notes on "statistical physics for communication and computer science" written by Nicolas Macris and Ruediger Urbanke. Later on I realized that these notes were actually <a href = "https://ipg.epfl.ch/page-136872-en.html" target="_blank"> lecture notes for a class </a> at the <a href = "https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank"> Ecole Politechnique Federale de Lausanne </a> in Switzerland. This little <a href = "files/bipartite.java"> Java program </a> is a solution to the first question in the first homework I found in that class' webpage. Someday if I have time I might try to solve more of those problems.
		  </p>
		  <p Class = "proyecto"> TicTacToe </p>
		  <p Class = "contenido"> I created this TicTacToe game just for fun using Processing. The one here is a very tiny version, but the code is scalable to make it any size you want. I never enabled the "new game" button, so right now the only way to start over is to refresh the whole webpage.

We submited it to the UNAM short animation film contest that year, but it did not win. I still think it is a great animation and I am proud to have been part of it. Specifically, I worked on modelling and rigging, and taught Intton how to do the cell fracturing for when the things break. We used Blender.

				  Final Project!!
			  </a> - Since I was already in the surrealist mood, I decided to make my final project to be a tribute to Remedios Varo. The character is supposed to resemble "Mujer Saliendo del Psicoanalista". Throughout the animation, this fantastic character travels though "Transito en Espiral" on board of a boat from "Exploracion de los Recursos del Rio Orinoco". In each of the windows of the spiral, we can see different scenes inspired by some of the paintings of the artist, such as "Despedida", "El Paraiso de los Gatos", "Valle de la Luna", "Papilla Estelar", and "La Creacion de los Pajaros".

			</a>- I went to this course in the Summer of 2012 and it was one of the greatest experiences in my life. I made some of the best friends I have today there, and I learned the meaning of empathy and the importance of education. I also learned how to listen actively, think critically, speak up, work in teams, and many more things. One of the biggest lessons I took from the course was that starting a project from scratch is always very hard and will almost always not turn out as planned. However, even if a project is not able to continue, this doesn't mean it failed, since you can always learn from the experience and try over and over again.
